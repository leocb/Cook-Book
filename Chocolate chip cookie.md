## Ingredients 🛒

- 200g (1.5 cups) of all purpose flour
- 3g (0.5 teaspoon) of kosher salt (flakey salt)
- 4g (0.5 teaspoon) of baking soda (bicarbonato)
- 200g of dark chocolate
- 112g (0.5 cup) of unsalted butter
- 200g (0.75 cup) of packed brown sugar
- 112g (0.5 cup) of white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 6g of vanilla extract

## Prepare 👨‍🍳

1. Take the flour, salt and baking soda and mix them all together in a bowl
2. Rough chop the dark chocolate - aka. big chunks
3. Melt the butter in a pan
4. in another bowl, at a slow mixing speed, mix the two sugars and then add in the melted butter and then a whole egg
5. increase the mix speed to medium and add an egg yolk and the vanilla extract
6. once all of these are mixed, add the mixed flour soda and salt from step 1
7. Turn off the mixer and add the chocolate and mix it in by hand
8. Cover the dough with pvc plastic wrap (saran wrap) and let it rest in the fridge for 30 to 45 minutes (or longer, the more the better)

## Bake 🔥

1.  heat the oven to 180°C
2. use cookie scoops (or ice cream scoops for big cookies) and place them in a tray, with plenty of space between them
3. bake in the oven for 8 to 10 min for the normal cookies or 12 to 15min for the big cookies
4. Cookie hack: while baking, interrupt the baking and lift the tray and drop it inside the oven, this will pop the bubbles inside the cookie. do this 3 times while baking at different time intervals
